# Learning Statistics for datsci

I plan to supplement my stats learning from EDSA by using Allen Downey's [ThinkStats2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf) book and corresponding [code/data](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2)

I plan to summarize my notes in jupyter notebooks stored here.
