# The minimum journal entry
Every time you switch projects, open up your journal and enter the following three things:

1. Note the time. Most people will find having these timestamps to be useful to look back on.
1. Write a few sentences about what you just worked on. “What project did I just finish? Are there any parts of that project that I’m still thinking about?” Use complete sentences rather than one word answers. “Email. Yes.” is not a valid answer.
1. Write a few sentences about what you’re about to work on. “What is the first action of the project I’m about to start? How should I approach getting the project done?”
