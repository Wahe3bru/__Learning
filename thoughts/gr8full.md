# Today i am greatful for ...

### Monday 19 March
- i noticed how i was negatively affecting Ruby and remedied it immediately. I should definitely look out more for that.
- i joined Lu'Lu on the kitchen floor (playing) and changed Amber's winging to joyful playing with all 3 girls dogpiling on me.
- I had the choice to stay at home but decided to go to work instead and completed my hypothesis test! i'm glad about my decision to do the effort
